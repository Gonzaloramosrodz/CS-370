Artifact: Pirate Intelligent Agent Jupyter Notebook
Project Summary

For this project, I worked on building a Pirate Intelligent Agent using reinforcement learning techniques. I was provided with some starter code that included the environment setup, the basic structure of the agent class, and the reward system. I created the majority of the agent’s learning logic myself, including implementing the Q-learning algorithm, tuning the exploration versus exploitation balance (epsilon-greedy strategy), and designing the training loop to allow the agent to improve its behavior over time. I also handled plotting the agent’s performance to visualize learning progress.
Connection to Computer Science

Throughout this course, I learned about the foundations of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. These skills connect to the larger field of computer science by demonstrating how computational systems can adapt, learn from data, and solve complex problems without direct human intervention. Computer scientists play a crucial role in designing intelligent systems that impact industries like healthcare, transportation, and finance, ultimately improving quality of life and enabling new capabilities.

When approaching problems, I now think like a computer scientist: I break down problems into smaller parts, consider the available algorithms, and select solutions based on efficiency and effectiveness. I also learned the importance of iteration and experimentation, particularly in tuning hyperparameters and evaluating model performance.

Ethically, I recognize my responsibility to design systems that are fair, transparent, and safe for end users. It is critical to consider privacy, bias, and potential misuse when building intelligent agents. As a developer, I must prioritize not only functionality but also the well-being of users and the reputation of the organization deploying the technology.
